# Cyber ​​Kill Chain 

The **Cyber Kill Chain** is a cybersecurity model developed by Lockheed Martin to describe the stages of a cyberattack. It provides a structured approach to understanding and mitigating threats by identifying and breaking the chain of events attackers follow to achieve their goals.

## Reconnaissance
**Reconnaissance** is the first phase in the Cyber Kill Chain, where attackers gather information about their target to plan their attack effectively. This stage is critical because it lays the foundation for the subsequent phases.

* **Question 1 :** What is the name of the Intel Gathering Tool that is a web-based interface to the common tools and resources for open-source intelligence?


      Answer : OSINT Framework

* **Question 2 :** What is the definition for the email gathering process during the stage of reconnaissance?

      Answer : Email harvesting 

## Weaponization
**Weaponization** is the second phase of the Cyber Kill Chain, where attackers create or prepare malicious tools or payloads to exploit the vulnerabilities identified during the **Reconnaissance** phase. This phase bridges the gap between gathering information and delivering an attack.

* **Question :** This term is referred to as a group of commands that perform a specific task. You can think of them as subroutines or functions that contain the code that most users use to automate routine tasks. But malicious actors tend to use them for malicious purposes and include them in Microsoft Office documents. Can you provide the term for it? 

      Answer : Macro
## Delivery
**Delivery** is the third phase of the Cyber Kill Chain, where attackers transmit the weaponized payload to the target. This phase is critical as it bridges the preparation and execution of an attack. The success of the delivery phase often determines whether the attack proceeds to the next stage.

* **Question :** What is the name of the attack when it is performed against a specific group of people, and the attacker seeks to infect the website that the mentioned group of people is constantly visiting.

      Answer : Watering hole attack

## Exploitation

**Exploitation** is the fourth phase of the Cyber Kill Chain, where the attacker takes advantage of a vulnerability in the target system to execute the malicious payload. This phase marks the transition from delivery to the actual compromise of the system.

* **Question :** 
Can you provide the name for a cyberattack targeting a software vulnerability that is unknown to the antivirus or software vendors?

      Answer: Zero-day
## Installation

**Installation** is the fifth phase of the Cyber Kill Chain, where the attacker establishes a foothold on the compromised system. This step involves deploying malware or tools to ensure persistence, enabling the attacker to maintain access and carry out further operations.

* **Question :** Can you provide the technique used to modify file time attributes to hide new or changes to existing files?

      Answenr : Timestomping

## Command & Control (C2)

**Command & Control (C2)** is the sixth stage in the Cyber Kill Chain, where the attacker establishes communication between their malicious tools and a central server or infrastructure. This connection enables the attacker to issue commands, retrieve data, and maintain control over compromised systems.

* **Question :** What is the C2 communication where the victim makes regular DNS requests to a DNS server and domain which belong to an attacker. 

      Answer : DNS Tunelling
  ## Actions on Objectives (Exfiltration)

**Actions on Objectives** is the final stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, where attackers achieve their ultimate goals. This phase involves executing the purpose of the attack, which could include data theft, system disruption, espionage, financial gain, or other malicious activities.

* **Question :** Can you provide a technology included in Microsoft Windows that can create backup copies or snapshots of files or volumes on the computer, even when they are in use? 

      Answer : Shadow Copy
