# 🔍 Overview: What Is a Risk Assessment?

A risk assessment identifies potential threats and vulnerabilities to an information system, evaluates the likelihood and impact of these threats, and recommends mitigation strategies to reduce risk to acceptable levels.

# ✅ Step-by-Step: How to Perform a Risk Assessment

## **Step 1: Define Scope and Objectives**

- What system(s) are you assessing? (e.g., HR system, payroll, ICS, cloud platform)
- What are the goals of this assessment? (e.g., compliance, audit readiness, policy enforcement)

### 📄 Key Documents Needed:
- System Description  
- Organizational Information Security Policy  
- Network Diagrams  
- Data Flow Diagrams  
- Asset Register

---

## **Step 2: Identify Assets**

- List all critical assets: hardware, software, data, users, network segments, etc.  
- Identify data classifications (e.g., public, internal, confidential, regulated).

### 📄 Documents Needed:
- Asset Inventory   
- Data Classification Policy  

---

## **Step 3: Identify Threats and Vulnerabilities**

- Use threat intelligence, vulnerability scans, and standards like NIST SP 800-30 or ISO 27005.  
- Common threats: phishing, malware, unauthorized access, data breach, insider threat.

### 📄 Documents/Tools:
- Vulnerability Scan Reports (Nessus, Qualys, etc.)  
- Threat Library (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK, OWASP Top 10)  
- Previous Incident Reports  

---

## **Step 4: Assess Existing Security Controls**

- Document technical, administrative, and physical controls in place.  
- Determine if controls are preventive, detective, or corrective.

### 📄 Reference Materials:
- Security Policy  
- Access Control Policy  
- Firewall/IDS Logs  
- Backup and Disaster Recovery Plans  

---

## **Step 5: Analyze Risk**

- Use a risk matrix or risk equation:  
  `Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Impact`

- Score risks based on:
  - Likelihood (e.g., Rare to Almost Certain)
  - Impact (e.g., Low to Critical)

### 📊 Tool to Use:
- Risk Register spreadsheet  
- Risk Matrix Template  

---

## **Step 6: Recommend Mitigation Measures**

For each risk, suggest one of the following:
- **Avoid**: Stop using the risky system/process  
- **Transfer**: Outsource or insure the risk  
- **Mitigate**: Add controls to reduce risk  
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor  

### 📄 Deliverables:
- Mitigation Plan  
- Control Enhancement Proposal  

---

## **Step 7: Document Everything (Write the Risk Assessment Report)**

### 📝 Structure of the Risk Assessment Report

#### **Executive Summary**
- Purpose, scope, methodology, summary of major risks and recommendations  

#### **Introduction**
- Description of the system assessed  
- Objectives of the assessment  

#### **Methodology**
- Standards used (e.g., ISO 27005, NIST SP 800-30)  
- Tools used (Nessus, Splunk, questionnaires, interviews)  

#### **Asset Identification**
- List of critical assets and their classification  

#### **Threats and Vulnerabilities**
- Table or narrative describing major threats and identified vulnerabilities  

#### **Risk Analysis**
- Risk matrix or heat map  
- Scoring criteria used (e.g., 1–5 scale for likelihood and impact)  

#### **Control Evaluation**
- Summary of current controls and their effectiveness  

#### **Risk Treatment Recommendations**
- Action plan, control enhancements, timelines, responsible teams  

#### **Conclusion**
- Summary of residual risk  
- Next steps (e.g., re-assessment, audit preparation)  

#### **Appendices**
- Risk Register  
- Raw Scan Reports  
- Interview Notes
